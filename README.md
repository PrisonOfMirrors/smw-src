# smw-src
Source code to Super Mario World (SNES disassembly)

## Introduction

This was my first large-scale reverse engineering project. It is based on the documentation `all.log` provided by smwcentral and assembles a binary exact ROM.

An older modified version of WLA is used to assemble the code. A modified tool that can handle all graphic formats is provided, but sadly I have lost the source code.

__This project is being archived for historical purposes, as-is, and I do not intend to continue it__

## Compiling

Extract the archive located in the `bin` folder. Run `wla.bat` in the root and follow the instructions. It simplifies the need to manually type out a bunch of shit in the command line.
